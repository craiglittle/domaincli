== What is it ==

DomainCLI is a simple command-line interface for registering domain names:

  gdb@inferno:~$ domaincli check domaincli.com
  Checking status of domaincli.com... Available!
  gdb@inferno:~$ domaincli register domaincli.com
  Trying to register tseaute.com... success!
   \--> Congatulations!  You now own domaincli.com

== Installation ==

Download and run the 'domaincli' script on your machine.  There should be no
dependencies beyond the Python that came with your Linux or Mac.  If you run
into any compatibility or dependency problems, please email
gdb@gregbrockman.com.
